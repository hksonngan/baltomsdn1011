Code from our talk on 10/18/11

##Topic

Image Manipulation with HTML5: improving the speed of clinical decision making and kicking butt

##Abstract

Learn how we leveraged Javascript and HTML5 technologies to build an extremely responsive medical image (DICOM) viewer and reduced the complexity (and load) of our server code by an order of magnitude. Our application is written in C# MVC3. To build the viewer we leveraged razor templates, backbone.js, and jquery templates. On the HTML5 side, we used canvas, webworkers and filestreams. This is not a hypothetical talk. We’ll show you how we used these technologies to make a real application that is used by physicians to save lives today.
